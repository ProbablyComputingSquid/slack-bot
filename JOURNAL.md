June 9th, 2025: 
16:33 - time to setup cronjobs
16:43 - who cares about cronjobs when my code doesnt work :Despair:
16:48 -  diagnosed the problem, apparently it's using "true timezones" per the stackoverflow post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13866926/is-there-a-list-of-pytz-timezones which i did not realize is different than timezone abbreviations
16:54 - made dates default to today instead of january 01, 1900
17:04 - added some more niche timezones, i guess the guam users (literally none) will be happy
17:12 - weh im fixing unit tests
17:12 - more coverage? or im adjusting unit tests to fit my outputs 
17:14 - timezones are so weird
17:25 im confused why is pytz telling me that times are off by like 4 minutes huh
17:47 - reading through block kit docs
17:50 - converthelp time, we using block kit for this one ig
